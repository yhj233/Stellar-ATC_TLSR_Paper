### 按照自己喜好修改了样式 时钟模式1为日历 目前支持M3N特别批次和原项目不支持的新版Stellar-M

> 我的Stellar-M批次为101915 屏幕型号 <br>

Stellar-M其他批次有DEPT的屏幕 主控可能为UC8251

### 显示效果在Release里 随便说一下目前老化的屏幕不建议在屏幕上画很粗的线条 
### 会导致那部分区域损坏 尤其是目前的那几个固件(没有批评的意思，我的屏老化使用才会这样) 也是因此重写了样式

# TL;DR
> **Warning** <br>
> This firmweare may include high battery usage.

This repo was made by splicing these two repos: [ATC_TLSR_Paper](https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_TLSR_Paper) [stellar-L3N-etag](https://github.com/reece15/stellar-L3N-etag)

Updated ota controll panel (for the firmweare): [web](https://garobcsi.github.io/ATC_TLSR_Paper/web_tools/) 

This firmweare made to work on S3N@ E31HA. Other models may not work correctly.

# ATC_TLSR_Paper
Custom BLE firmware for Hanshow E-Paper Shelf Labels / Price Tags using the TLSR8359 ARM SOC

<h1 style="color:red;font-size:25px;">Please note that this firmware ONLY works on Price Tags with the TLSR Microcontroller! Make sure to check the <a href="#compatible-hanshow-models">list of compatible models</a>.</h1>


### You can support my work via PayPal: https://paypal.me/hoverboard1 this keeps projects like this coming.

As BLE can be enabled on the Telink TLSR8359 so i decided to make a custom firmware instead of reversing the stock firmware and its 2.4Ghz RF Protocol

This repo is made together with this explanation video:(click on it)

#### Compiling:
Python needs to be installed
##### Windows:
To compile under windows navigate with a command prompt to the "Firmware" folder

Enter "makeit.exe" and wait till the Compiling is done.


##### Linux:
Navigate with a Terminal into the "Firmware" Folder

Enter "make" and wait till the Compiling is done.

#### Flashing:
Open the Compiled .bin firmware with the WebSerial Flasher and write it to Flash.

On first Connection it is needed to Unlock the flash of the TLSR8359

#### About the display:
The e-ink panel used in this ESL is 250 by 122 pixels, black and white (no gray levels...yet).

Larry Bank added his OneBitDisplay (https://github.com/bitbank2/OneBitDisplay) and TIFF_G4 (https://github.com/bitbank2/TIFF_G4) libraries to make it easy to generate text and graphics. For anyone wanting to write directly to the display buffer, the memory is laid out like a typical 1-bpp bitmap except that it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. In other words, the display is really 122 wide by 250 tall, but laying on its side. Each byte contains 8 pixels with the most significant bit on the left. Black is 0 and white is 1. Each row of 122 pixels uses 16 bytes. Here is an example function to set a pixel given the x,y of the orientation (portrait) that the display is used:<br>
<br>
```
void SetPixel(int x, int y, uint8_t *pDisplayBuffer)
{
   uint8_t *d = &pDisplayBuffer[(y >> 3) + (249-x)*16];
   *d &= ~(0x80 >> (y & 7)); // set pixel to black
}
```


The following hardware is currently supported,
most displays are detected automatically if that fails you can select the correct one in the OTA flashing tool.
The graphical layout is not edited for each screen size and will not fit nicely on all especially the 1.54" Version.

## Compatible Hanshow models:
Hanshow [explains](https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/2AHB5-M3NT/4535921.pdf) their naming scheme as follows:
> Stellar-XXX E31X  
> XXX and X stand for hardware, such as Stellar-M3YN@ E31H
> - M = 2.13 inch
> - 3 = three-color display: black/white/red
> - Y = three-color display: black/white/yellow
> - N = NFC chip
> - H = High-resolution
> - A = No reed switch
> - @ = LED light

This firmware requires hardware based on the TLSR8359 chip, which is usually the case for Stellar-xxNx models, but **not** models without an N.

The following models have been confirmed to work:
